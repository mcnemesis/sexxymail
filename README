  what the heck? sexxymail is something that's more like joke turned serious!
  I had this idea i joked about - imagine waking up in the morning and there's this nice
  voice that reads to you all yo new mail as u brush teeth?!
 
  seemed like at first, but when I encountered some little knowwn APIs and breakthroughs at Google
  I decided to make this one of my "over-night" hacks
  and like many of those, I didn't do it perfectly, but it gets the job done a bit:
  currently:
 
  1. sexxymail will hook into yo IMAP mail server (configurable)
  2. get you "folders" list, and prompt u to select one
  3. then will read all new / unread mail to you via a possibly "sexxy" voice (thanks to Google's innovations)
  4. If not closed, the program will periodically attempt to check for and read any new mail to u
 
  Note : because o bandwidth issues on my box, I decided to only make the tool read out only "From" and "subject" headers,
 but it should be hard to read the entire mail body should u require such functionality.
  
 -- and then one small zib is that for each mail it checks out, the mail's flag "\Seen" is set, so that on the server,
 that message is marked as read - which might not be a good thing if u intend to later on read the mail in say gmail or some
 other client, but to compesate for this, i make Sexxy set the "SexxyFeeds" label on this "checkout" mail, so that u can
 later on read it in one place if so required by navigating to mail under this label.

Licences? This is unlicenced work! Do with it whatever u wish! Just don't involve me please incase u use it to do evil please :-)

But do let me know if it turns out to be useful for anything otherthan amusement, and let me know if there are improvements (definitely)
that I can make to it.

Lastly : current codebase is .NET in C#, but u could port it to anything else
